# Indeed-WebpageRecreate
A sample of Indeed.com's webpage

Still very much a work in progress. Need to add more content and correct spacing. Working on the main structure at the moment. Will eventually link external stylesheet.

Update:

Navbar section looks good. Spacing very similar to actual webpage. One issue, is the blue underline when hovering. Currently causes whole page to shift down slightly. Will return to this in the future. 

Managed to get the first 'jobPosting' div to receive blue border when clicked. Need to apply this to others and return non-clicked div back to grey border.

Stay tuned.
